## Manufacturing

Manufacturing of this frame is pretty straight forward. I suggest to let someone professional mill the carbon parts, but all 3D printed parts are optimized for easy printing on FDM printers.

### Carbon parts

- `/base/base*`
  - 2mm
- `/base/arm*`
  - 3mm

### 3D printed parts

- `/base/pod*`

All parts should pe printed in TPU. Also all parts can be printed without support structures.

## Compatibility

Most parts are made with Fusion 360.

The pod is build around micro sized fpv cams (19mm x 19mm) and the TBS Unify nano vtx.
